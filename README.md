## 1. Intro

<p align="justify">
Welcome to my Personal invetion of the task given, I call it Address Grouping Web Application build in Python. 
In the following READ.ME file you find all of the information you need to set up the environment on your local machine. 
You will receive a throughout instructions of which librabries you need to install and the all of the updates you need to perform in order to have this web functioning right. 

<div>DISCLAIMER:
I did not attach it to any free domain server or any free hsoting servers for a technical convinience.

## 2. Prerequisites

To run the Address Grouping Web Application, you need to ensure that Python and the required Python packages are installed on your local machine. Here are the prerequisites:

***Python***: You must have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
<br>
***Flask***: Flask is a web framework for Python. You can install Flask using pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
<br>
```
pip install flask
```

***Pandas***: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. Install it using pip:
<br>
```pip install pandas```
<br>
Once you have installed Python, Flask, and Pandas, you can clone the repository containing the Address Grouping Web Application and navigate to the project directory. Cloning command: 

<br>
```git clone https://github.com/AlexMitev01/Python-Task.git```

Then run the follwoing, commnad to start the project: 
<br>
```python app.py```

After running the command, the Flask development server will start, and you can access the web application by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.(
<i> If the port is used by another program on local machine you can always change the configuration on the app.py of the project <i>


Make sure to follow these steps to ensure the smooth execution of the Address Grouping Web Application on your local machine.

## 3.Functionality:

Now that you have done all of the above mentioned steps, you can continue to the core of the applicaiton:

**Input Data**
You can input data through two methods:

File Upload: Upload a .csv file containing the data with two columns: Name and Address.
Manual Text Entry: Input data directly into the provided text field on the user interface.
Process Data
Once data is entered, click the "Process" button to initiate the grouping process.

**Download Results**
After processing, download the grouped results as a .txt file by clicking the "Download Results" button.

## 4. Final Notes

If you have read all of the file, I have carefully constructed for you, well congratulations!!! Now you must have a working local web-app on for Addresing Groups build in Python>.
